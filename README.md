## Tecnologies

The technologies used to create my portolio are CSS, HTML5 and JavaScript.

## Installation Instructions

My portfolio should run without the need for installation. If you are without a web browser, you will need to install a web browser before visiting my portfolio. I like [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/?brand=CHBD&gclid=CjwKCAiAl9efBhAkEiwA4TorihsA2NcF01Tp-7OCSv9dPwm5DiMiFnu3IrbCEfG1zoQZjQlV-kuGmRoCiysQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds).

## User Stories

•As a friend of Sam's, I want to understand what he's working on and his place in his new career field, so that I can better support him.

## Wireframes

My wireframes were ambitious and exceeded my abilities by just a bit. I did my best to maintain the original intent, but ultimately adjusted my plans to fit my abilities.

## Unsolved Problems & Hurdles

As mentioned above, there was more I had hoped to do. I would have loved to make the whole site more interactive and animated, but I opted to make a fully functional site, rather than include a few animations.
